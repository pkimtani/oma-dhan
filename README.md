# OmaDhan

Oma (="My own" in Finnish) Dhan (= "Money/Wealth" in Hindi), therefore meaning, "My own Wealth" in English.
This project is inspired by Splitwise and Ghostfolio.
The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a self sufficient tool to manage your finances and know your net worth.

This app is still in development and is being actively supported by my current employer [Wunderdog Oy](https://wunderdog.io).
